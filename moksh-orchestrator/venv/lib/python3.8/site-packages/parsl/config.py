    """
    Specification of Parsl configuration options.

    Parameters
    ----------
    executors : list of ParslExecutor, optional
        List of executor instances to use. Possible executors include :class:`~parsl.executors.threads.ThreadPoolExecutor`,
        :class:`~parsl.executors.ipp.IPyParallelExecutor`, or :class:`~parsl.executors.swift_t.TurbineExecutor`. Default
        is [:class:`~parsl.executors.threads.ThreadPoolExecutor()`].
    app_cache : bool, optional
        Enable app caching. Default is True.
    checkpoint_files : list of str, optional
        List of paths to checkpoint files. Default is None.
    checkpoint_mode : str, optional
        Checkpoint mode to use, can be 'dfk_exit', 'task_exit', or 'periodic'. If set to
        `None`, checkpointing will be disabled. Default is None.
    checkpoint_period : str, optional
        Time interval (in "HH:MM:SS") at which to checkpoint completed tasks. Only has an effect if
        `checkpoint_mode='periodic'`.
    data_management_max_threads : int, optional
        Maximum number of threads to allocate for the data manager to use for managing input and output transfers.
        Default is 10.
    monitoring : MonitoringHub, optional
        The config to use for database monitoring. Default is None which does not log to a database.
    lazy_errors : bool, optional
        If True, errors from task failures will not be raised until `future.result()` is called. Otherwise, they will
        be raised as soon as the task returns. Default is True.
    retries : int, optional
        Set the number of retries in case of failure. Default is 0.
    run_dir : str, optional
        Path to run directory. Default is 'runinfo'.
    strategy : str, optional
        Strategy to use for scaling resources according to workflow needs. Can be 'simple' or `None`. If `None`, dynamic
        scaling will be disabled. Default is 'simple'.
    max_idletime : float, optional
        The maximum idle time for an executor in the 'simple' strategy. Default is 120.0 seconds.
    usage_tracking : bool, optional
        Set this field to True to opt-in to Parsl's usage tracking system. Parsl only collects minimal, non personally-identifiable,
        information used for reporting to our funding agencies. Default is False.
    initialize_logging : bool, optional
        Make DFK optionally not initialize any logging. Log messages
        will still be passed into the python logging system under the
        `parsl` logger name, but the logging system will not by default
        perform any further log system configuration. Most noticeably,
        it will not create a parsl.log logfile.  The use case for this
        is when parsl is used as a library in a bigger system which
        wants to configure logging in a way that makes sense for that
        bigger system as a whole.
